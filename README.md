# Probable-Bassoon

# Steps

## there was 6 different sections of code that were duplicated 3 times each and just needed to be consolidated based on how they were being targeted.

## as of the HTML I needed to determine which out of all of the tags were considered non semantic and understanding how they were layed out on the page.

## everything was set up as non semantic tags such as divs, I switched the first div section to the header and the div that had the unordered list to the nav.

## the rest of the divs became sections except for the div that contained the Lead generation, Brand awareness, and cost management. It became an aside tag to let the user know that these sections are places to the side of the screen.

## The last div became the footer.
