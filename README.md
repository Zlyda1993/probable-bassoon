# Recomposition
Using recomposition of non-semantic tags to semantic tags, i was able to keep the webpage looking the same while allowing the end users to view it even if they were to use a screen reader.
It also helps on the development end to allow other developers to easily understand what areas of the code line up to what they are seeing at a quick glance.
This makes it easier for anyone, whether me or another developer, to go in and make any necessary changes to the code.
